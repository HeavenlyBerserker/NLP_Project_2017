Instructions so far:

1. To install python repositories and test the system on a file, run test.sh with the filename to test and answers as a single argument:

	./infoextract.sh <textfile>
	
	For instance, if using the following code, prediction would run on "sample-textfile.txt" for input text and "sample-answers.txt" for input answers file.:
	
	./infoextract.sh sample 

2. [Optional] To start learning process. This may take a few dozen seconds, so run at your own peril. Run project.py with no arguments. Suggested version 2.7.12
	
	python project.py

Team member contributions.

Hong Xu: Was responsible for writing the code to parse the files into usable text format. Created the system to create patterns and find triggers. Implemented a way to classify incidents by frequency of certain words. Responsible for the testing and experimentation on the test files.

Change log:
2017-10-29 Added readme file and did some modifications to the code.
2017-10-29 Parsed the file further. Now each file has been put with
			its answers, parsed answers, raw text, and parsed sentences.
2017-10-29 Added finding important words
2017-11-04 Figured out parser and created some patterns. Work in progress.
2017-11-04 Wrote a custom parser using the nltk tagger. Results are okay. Higher correct answer instances in answers.
2017-11-05 Wrote predict.py to start evaluating answers.
2017-11-05 Tried using verbs and verb phrases as trigger words. Experiments failed, so we are using any word with high P log F score.
2017-11-06 Struggled with finding better parsers, expecially in terms of separating subjects, DOs and PPs.
2017-11-06 Tried different configurations for detecting incidents by exploring the ratio between words that appear in articles vs other articles, capped at around 50% recall.
2017-11-06 With prunning of some answers, obtained a recall of 20%, but still low precision of 1%.
2017-11-06 Improved recall to ~25%.
2017-11-07 Trying to improve system to no avail.
